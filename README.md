# dynamic-url-proxy
Microservice for generating dynamic urls

This microservice can be used to
  * dynamically build url based on some function evaluation

Main idea behind is that filenames or urls might have -for instance- datetime related fix in their names. With this microservice you can build a url in "replace substring" manner and forward the call as if you are calling it directly.

#How-TO
For every dynamic part in your url:
  * replace it by [<part_name>]
  * add a query parameter <part_name>=<python_function_to_be_evaluated>

Check the LOCALS variable value in the [code](./service/proxy-service.py#L25) to see the modules available to 'eval' function in addition to builtins module. You will have to customize after your needs, if any.

### example config in SESAM
